When a person1 wants to book a meeting with person2 he will send an email requesting for the date and time of the meeting. Person1 is not available at the requested time so he gives a date and time to person2 at which he is free. This is a long and cumbersome process so BookOmatic solves this by showing person1 the date and time slots person2 is free so he can book his meeting immediately.
